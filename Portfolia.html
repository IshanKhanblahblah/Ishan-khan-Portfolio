<h1>Bonjour !,  Myself<br/></h1>

  <h4>ABOUT</h4>
  <p>Hey there! I am Ishan Khan, currently navigating the chaos of being a sophomore in B-Tech (ECE), trying to balance circuits, code, and caffeine. I dabble in HTML, CSS, and Python, which means I can make a website look decent, and I might just be able to automate something (or break it trying).
    When I'm not buried in textbooks or debugging code at 3 AM, I am probably pretending to be productive. 
    If you're into tech, sarcasm, and the occasional burst of genius (or accidental brilliance), you are in the right place. I thrive on collaboration and love exchanging ideas, whether it is about the latest programming languages or upcoming movies. I often find myself lost in online tutorials, trying to master new skills or discover how things work under the hood.
    In my free time, you can find me reading comics, binge-watching sitcoms, playing football, or indulging in photography. And of course, I can not forget about hanging out with friends because who doesn't love pretending to have a social life while secretly plotting world domination (or just deciding where to grab pizza)?
    Anyways, Let's try to make something coolâ€”or at least functional! Together.

I find immense joy in tinkering with hardware, whether it's building a simple circuit or diving into the realm of microcontrollers.
 I believe that the best way to learn is by doing.
